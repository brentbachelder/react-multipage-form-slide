# React Multipage Form with Sliding Transitions
Simple React component that you can use to create multipage forms that have a sliding transition.

Change 'componentWidth' and 'componentHeight' to match for your project needs. The frames (main content) can be any type of HTML element or a React component. You can change the speed of the transition by changing the 'transitionSpeed' variable.
